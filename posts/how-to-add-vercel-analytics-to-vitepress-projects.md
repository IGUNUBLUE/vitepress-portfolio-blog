Hello there! I hope this message finds you well. Before I dive into today's topic, I want to share an important update with you all. From now on, I'll be writing all my blog posts in English. I hope this decision will help me reach a wider audience and connect with more people who share similar interests. With that said, let's get started with today's post!.

In this post, I'll provide a short tutorial on how to configure Vercel/Analytics for Vitepress projects. When I tried to test the Vercel/Analytics product, I couldn't find a clear step-by-step guide on this topic. So, let's get started.

## Step one:
[Visit the official Vercel/Analytics documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/analytics/package) and look for the option to add the script to an HTML file. It should look like this:

## Step two:
Navigate to the **.vitepress** folder and open the **config.js** file with your preferred IDE. Then, add the following line to the **defineConfig** object, at the same level as the **title** property:

```javascript
  head: [["script", { src: "/_vercel/insights/script.js", defer: true }]],
```
